# Documentation for Proper Use of the Deluge Client

## Step 1: Access the Torrent Index

First, go to [Torrust Demo](https://index.torrust-demo.com/torrents).

## Step 2: Download the Desired Torrent

Next, download the torrent you wish to use. Ensure that the torrent has seeders; otherwise, the download will be impossible.

For this example, we will download the first torrent that appears (`debian-12.5.0-amd64-netinst.iso`).

A file explorer will open. Here, you can either browse for the torrent file you downloaded or drag and drop it directly. Dragging and dropping is recommended due to potential issues with the client's file browser.
