# Documentation for Proper Use of the Transmission Client

## Step 1: Access the Torrent Index

First, go to [Torrust Demo](https://index.torrust-demo.com/torrents).

## Step 2: Download the Desired Torrent

Next, download the torrent you wish to use. Ensure that the torrent has seeders; otherwise, the download will be impossible.

For this example, we will download the first torrent that appears (`debian-12.5.0-amd64-netinst.iso`).
